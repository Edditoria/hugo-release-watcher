# Hugo Release Watcher

This is a quick and dirty mini-project to examine the filename in releases of [Hugo][official_site], an awesome static website generator.

I created this for another project [asdf-hugo][asdf-hugo_repo], my own asdf-plugin to manage multiple Hugo cli for macOS and Linux.

This project requires Deno to run.
